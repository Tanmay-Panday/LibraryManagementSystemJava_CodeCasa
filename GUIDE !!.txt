HELLO!!

THIS GUIDE WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTNAND HOW TO OPEN THIS ..

I AM GOING TO PLACE A LIBRARIES FOLDER IN WHICH I WILL PLACE SUPPORTED JAR FILES.
AFTER YOU PLACE THOSE FILES IN LIBRARIES FOLDER WHICH IS LOCATED BELOW  ' Test Packages '

TO PLACE THESE FILES, YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO RIGHT CLICK AND SELECT ADD JAR FILES
THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT ALL FILES UNDER THE GIVEN LIBRARIES FOLDER INSIDE LMS ICONS AND OTHER STUFF AND ADD THEM.

AFTER ADDING THEM , SIMPLY RESTART NETBEANS AND YOU CAN RUN ALL THE FILES..

ENJOY :)
